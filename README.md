To use the source code it is recommended to use Visual Studios with the extension PlatformIO. In PlatformIO you need to download four libraries:  Adafruit CCS811 Library, ArduinoJson, SparkFun BME280, SparkFun CCS811 Arduino Library. To uploading actual code to the Weather station you need to click on the platformIO icon on the left most panel (ant shaped) and navigate to “project tasks” and then “Upload and monitor”. This opens a terminal showing you what is uploaded and later what is printed by the weather station in the terminal. For the Weather station to be able to connect to the internet you need to insert your network ssid and your password in the code by the “ssid” and “password” const char.
