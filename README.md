In PlatformIO you need to download four libraries:  Adafruit CCS811 Library, ArduinoJson, SparkFun BME280, SparkFun CCS811 Arduino Library. To uploading actual code to the Weather station you need to click on the platformIO icon on the left most panel (ant shaped) and navigate to “project tasks” and then “Upload and monitor”. This opens a terminal showing you what is uploaded and later what is printed by the weather station in the terminal.
